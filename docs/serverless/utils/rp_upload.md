# Upload Utility

The upload utility provides functions to upload files and in-memory objects to a S3 compatible bucket storage platform. It uses the [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) library to upload the files and objects to the bucket storage.

*Note: The upload utility utilizes the Virtual-hosted-style URL with the bucket name in the host name. For example, `https: // bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com`.*

## Bucket Credentials

You can set your S3 bucket credentials in the following ways:

### Environment Variables

```bash
# S3 Bucket
BUCKET_ENDPOINT_URL =  # S3 bucket endpoint url
BUCKET_ACCESS_KEY_ID =  # S3 bucket access key id
BUCKET_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY =  # S3 bucket secret access key
```

The credentials can be set in your Docker image using `ENV`, however, it is recommended to set them in the Runpod template using the `Environment Variables` property for security.

### Passed as a Dictionary

```python
bucket_creds = {
    'endpointUrl': 'https://your-bucket-endpoint-url.com',
    'accessId': 'your_access_key_id',
    'accessSecret': 'your_secret_access_key'
}
```

## Examples

These examples demonstrate how to use the provided functions to upload a file and an in-memory object to the bucket storage. They show how to set up the bucket credentials, define the file name and location (or data), and call the respective function to upload and obtain a presigned URL for the uploaded object. The examples also demonstrate how to use optional bucket_name and prefix parameters.

### upload_file_to_bucket

```python
from runpod.serverless.utils import upload_file_to_bucket

# Define your bucket credentials
bucket_creds = {
    'endpointUrl': 'https://your-bucket-endpoint-url.com',
    'accessId': 'your_access_key_id',
    'accessSecret': 'your_secret_access_key'
}

# Define the file name and file location
file_name = 'example.txt'
file_location = '/path/to/your/local/file/example.txt'

# Optional: Define a bucket_name and prefix
bucket_name = 'custom-bucket-name'
prefix = 'your-prefix'

# Upload the file and get the presigned URL
presigned_url = upload_file_to_bucket(file_name, file_location, bucket_creds, bucket_name, prefix)

# Print the presigned URL
print(f"Presigned URL: {presigned_url}")
```

### upload_in_memory_object

```python
from runpod.serverless.utils import upload_in_memory_object

# Define your bucket credentials
bucket_creds = {
    'endpointUrl': 'https://your-bucket-endpoint-url.com',
    'accessId': 'your_access_key_id',
    'accessSecret': 'your_secret_access_key',
    'bucketName': 'your_bucket_name'
}

# Define the file name and file data (bytes)
file_name = 'example.txt'
file_data = b'This is an example text.'

# Optional: Define a bucket_name and prefix
bucket_name = 'custom-bucket-name'
prefix = 'your-prefix'

# Upload the in-memory object and get the presigned URL
presigned_url = upload_in_memory_object(file_name, file_data, bucket_creds, bucket_name, prefix)

# Print the presigned URL
print(f"Presigned URL: {presigned_url}")
```
